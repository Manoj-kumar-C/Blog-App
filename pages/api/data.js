            When you’re trying to conceive, any slight new symptom can get your heart pounding. Waiting to see if two pink lines are in store for you this month can be agony, so it’s hard not to read into every twinge, cramp and extra trip to the bathroom. But what are the first signs of pregnancy you should really be on the lookout for? Will you really start craving strange food combinations? And what about morning sickness? Does every woman experience the same pregnancy symptoms?

Here, with the help of medical experts, we break down the most common early signs of pregnancy, why they happen and what you can do to ease any ensuing discomfort. (Because let’s be honest, the symptoms of pregnancy don’t always feel the greatest.)

When Do Pregnancy Symptoms Start?
There’s no hard and fast rule for when early pregnancy symptoms kick in. Some women may begin noticing the first early signs of pregnancy a week or two after conception, while others will start to feel symptoms closer to four or five weeks after, when your period is conspicuously late, or even farther into pregnancy. According to a study published in the Journal of Clinical Epidemiology, most women (59 percent) experienced an onset of pregnancy symptoms by their fifth or sixth week, while 71 percent reported symptoms by the end of week six and 89 percent by week eight.

Remember, each woman is on her own unique path to pregnancy, so symptoms and timing can vary. Whether you start to sense early symptoms of pregnancy immediately or later in pregnancy, don’t fret. “All women are different and don’t experience the same symptoms of early pregnancy,” says Michele Justice, MD, an ob-gyn at Inova Loudoun Hospital in Leesburg, Virginia. “Also, her second pregnancy can be different from her first.” And of course, just because you experience something that could be chalked up as a sign of pregnancy, it’s never a guarantee there’s a baby on board. If you think you might be pregnant, Justice says, your best bet is to take a pregnancy test.

1. Sore Breasts

Are your boobs killing you? Do they feel tender and swollen? If so, it’s possible you’ve conceived this cycle. Sore breasts are often among the first early symptoms of pregnancy that women experience, which means you can also expect sore nipples in early pregnancy. You may start noticing differences in the way your breasts look, and it’s not uncommon for them to feel heavy and swollen. This is an early sign that your body is gearing up to start making milk.

Unfortunately, a lot of women experience soreness as a normal part of their monthly menstrual cycle, so it can be hard to tell the difference between the typical breast tenderness before your period vs an early pregnancy sign. But there’s one key difference: In pregnancy, the tenderness doesn’t go away like it normally does with PMS, Justice says. Instead, the painful, tingly sensations tend to get worse as time passes, often leveling off around the end of the first trimester.
Why does it happen?

During early pregnancy, levels of estrogen and progesterone hormones spike, which causes increased blood flow to your breasts. These hormones are also why some women experience breast tenderness around the time of ovulation and as part of PMS—but in that case, the hormones begin to plummet as you get closer to the start of your period, and the breast pain subsides. If you’ve conceived, your hormone levels will rise rather than fall and your breasts will become increasingly tender.
Is it common?

Don’t worry, you’re not the only one dealing with tender breasts and sore nipples in early pregnancy—it’s one of the most common early symptoms of pregnancy. For many women it lasts just a week or so, but others experience some level of breast tenderness for their entire pregnancy. Take comfort in the fact that this pain and tenderness means your breasts are preparing to nourish baby after they’re born!
What should you do?

Get a supportive bra to ease the discomfort of this pregnancy symptom. Talk to a professional who can help you with a fitting, and be sure to leave a little extra room. Trust us, they’re going to keep growing. And don’t be afraid to use either warm or cold compresses if things get really uncomfortable—just use whichever feels right for you.

2. Darkening Areolas

If you’re searching for early signs of pregnancy, you may want to take a look at your areolas—aka the area around your nipples. They can start to appear darker and larger as early as one or two weeks after conception, making this one of the more noticeable early signs of pregnancy. And that’s not all—look closely and you’ll see that the veins in your breasts are more visible as well. You might also notice little bumps popping up around the edges of your areolas. They’re called Montgomery tubercles, designed to help lubricate your nipples once baby is here and ready to nurse. If you haven’t realized it yet, your breasts will undergo lots of changes during pregnancy!
Why does it happen?

Like so many early signs of pregnancy, darkening areolas and veins are likely a result of surging pregnancy hormones. Although it’s not completely understood yet what causes the darker color, the most widely accepted explanation is that estrogens and progesterone cause the pigment cells in the skin (melanocytes) to be more active.
Is it common?

Darker areolas and veins will probably be one of the first signs of pregnancy you’ll notice, and they’re both extremely common. And it doesn’t stop there: Your areolas may continue to grow and deepen in color as your pregnancy progresses. Sometimes the changes are permanent, sometimes they’re not.
What should you do?

As with so many other pregnancy symptoms, this is one that requires a grin-and-bear-it approach. The deepening color shouldn’t be a cause for concern—it’s a harmless part of the pregnancy experience. Your nipples are probably much more tender now too, especially when you’re cold or something rubs against them. Applying warm compresses and wearing a lightweight, soft cotton bra can help.

3. Cramping

Similar to sore breasts, cramping is among the early signs of pregnancy. The cramping shouldn’t be severe, though, so contact your doctor if you’re doubled over in pain, if you feel intense pain on only one side, or if you’re experiencing simultaneous bleeding and cramping (outside of your menstrual period, of course).
Why does it happen?

It can sometimes be difficult to distinguish between early pregnancy symptoms and signs that your period is on its way, especially when it comes to cramping. But even though they feel identical, cramps in pregnancy and period cramps are caused by different things. “The cramping that occurs during early pregnancy comes from the increased blood flow to the uterus,” Justice says. “The cramps before your period are due to increased prostaglandins that help the uterus prepare to shed its lining.”
Is it common?

Most women experience at least some cramping during their pregnancy. Just remember to contact your doctor if you’re worried or if it becomes severe.
What should you do?

If you’re having cramps, don’t panic. Many women immediately fear a miscarriage, but according to Kimberly Harney, MD, a clinical associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology and maternal fetal medicine at the California-based Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital Stanford, “mild cramping in the pelvis that’s symmetrical and generally in the center above the pubic bone could be normal in early pregnancy.”

4. Spotting

Having some light pink or brown spotting about a week before your period is due? If you’re wondering “can bleeding be a sign of pregnancy?” the answer is actually yes. It could be what’s called implantation bleeding, one of the early signs of pregnancy.

Spotting happens six to 12 days after conception, when a fertilized egg burrows deep into the lining of your uterus, causing a bit of mild irritation. When it’s happening, it can easily be confused with the onset of your period, so it’s one of those pregnancy symptoms that’s often noticed only in hindsight. “You probably won’t know that the irregular bleeding you had was implantation bleeding until you get that positive pregnancy test and remember that you had some spotting,” Justice says.
Why does it happen?

It means you’ve got a baby on the way! A few days after conception, the fertilized egg travels down the fallopian tubes and settles in your uterus. There, the egg will attach to the wall of your uterus. Since your uterine lining is rich with blood, a little spotting can often occur and isn’t cause for concern.
Is it common?

Implantation spotting occurs in about 25 percent of women, according to Justice, so you may or may not encounter it. Remember, every woman is unique and will experience pregnancy symptoms differently.
What should you do?

Keep your fingers crossed—this could be a good sign! Be sure to take a pregnancy test if your period is late to arrive to determine if your spotting really is an early sign of pregnancy. If it turns out you haven’t conceived, note the date the spotting occurred and which cycle day you were on. Pay close attention to your next few cycles and see if you notice any spotting—mid-cycle bleeding can be a sign of a medical condition that would require a doctor’s diagnosis, so definitely visit your ob-gyn if you notice a pattern.

5. High Basal Body Temperature

If you’ve been charting your basal body temp, you may be privy to one of the subtle signs of pregnancy that many women won’t even notice: a higher than normal reading. When you’re charting, your basal (or waking) temperature peaks when you ovulate, then gradually decreases during the latter part of your cycle until your period begins. But if you get pregnant during the cycle, your basal temperature won’t plummet; instead, it’ll stay high.
Why does it happen?

Like so many pregnancy symptoms, those pesky pregnancy hormones are to blame yet again. If you don’t get pregnant, your levels of progesterone and estrogen will decrease, signaling your period to begin. But if an egg is fertilized, the opposite happens, and these hormones begin to rapidly rise. Your basal body temp will reflect that rise and you won’t see a dip after ovulation.
Is it common?

It’s not just common, it’s biology, baby! Progesterone and estrogen are the hormones that sustain a healthy pregnancy. When you’re pregnant, a sustained high basal body temperature is one of the pregnancy symptoms you’re guaranteed to see.
What should you do?

If you’ve been charting, just keep doing what you’re doing and enjoy seeing those high temps. If you haven’t been tracking it and are trying to conceive, consider starting a basal temperature chart to become more familiar with your cycle. The best time to start your chart is the day your period begins.

            If you're not sure whether a particular activity is safe during pregnancy, check with your health care provider. Consider avoiding:

Any exercises that force you to lie flat on your back after your first trimester
Scuba diving, which could put your baby at risk of decompression sickness
Contact sports, such as ice hockey, soccer, basketball and volleyball
Activities that pose a high risk of falling — such as downhill skiing, in-line skating, gymnastics, and horseback riding
Activities that could cause you to hit water with great force, such as water skiing, surfing and diving
Other activities to avoid include:

Exercise at high altitude
Activities that could cause you to experience direct trauma to the abdomen, such as kickboxing
Hot yoga or hot Pilates
If you do exercise at a high altitude, make sure you know the signs and symptoms of altitude sickness, such as headache, fatigue and nausea. If you experience symptoms of altitude sickness, return to a lower altitude as soon as possible and seek medical care.

            When considering exercises for pregnancy, Cates says there aren’t a lot of activities that need to be removed from your current regimen.

“While the majority of exercises can be continued throughout each trimester, modifying and scaling back where needed can help increase the strength, stability, and physical adaptability as your body changes,” she says.

With that in mind, here are some general safety tips to consider when exercising during pregnancy, according to the ACOG.

            The highs and lows of pregnancy tests can be a killer. We all dream of that big fat positive (BFP), but sometimes you can tell the babymakin’ worked well before even taking a test (ugh, my achin’ boobs!). Bumpies on the 1st Trimester board shared how they knew :

“All of a sudden my dog smelled horrific even though he was clean and all smells/scents were much stronger." –Wildblue22

“I had been eating everything in sight! I normally had a pretty good appetite, but when my husband started commenting on my eating saying ‘how can you still be hungry?’ I knew there had to be a reason for it.” – shear22

“My boobs started hurting and I was so sleepy. I would desperately want a nap at all times of the day, which is weird for me.” – archyperu

“I started gagging while brushing my teeth, the week before I even tested. I just thought ‘well that’s new’ and kept about my business. I also started smelling everything and hating the way certain things smelled.” – ilovenaps

“My boobs hurt so bad and I noticed little stretch marks starting to form on the side of them. My husband also complained about me being irritated over everything and I would cry to sad songs on my iPod; I was kind of an emotional wreck.” – keni9

“I stopped liking chocolate!” – annya26

“My husband’s Old Spice aftershave started smelling like doughnuts. He smelled soooooo good! Then I noticed that I mysteriously did not have any PMS symptoms when I should have.” – redheadscu

“I like to enjoy a glass or two of wine every night. I kept feeling sick after having a glass, and it just didn’t taste good to me. Me not liking wine meant that something is going on.” – sascha3

“We were watching American Idol and I was exhausted, falling asleep all the time, I thought I had mono… I suddenly craved a bologna sandwich… which is nuts because I hate processed meat like that!” – jennjep24

            The digestive system is the most essential yet sensitive part of the human body. It consists of the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, and gallbladder.

It is essentially responsible for breaking down foods and liquids into chemical components such as protein, fats, and carbohydrates. Furthermore, it helps the body absorb these nutrients, utilising them as energy for proper functioning. Therefore, specific foods for the digestive system can help improve it whenever there is a process breakdown.

Our bodily functions depend heavily on food, which defines our internal health. A properly working digestive system plays a significant role in absorbing nutrients in the bloodstream, which are the body’s building blocks. Hence, maintaining an equilibrium of nutrients is essential for the proper functioning of the body.

            category: "Health",

            In this BBC program, “The Truth About Sleep,” which originally aired in 2017, Mosley investigates the health ramifications of insomnia, which is a problem he shares with many others in the world. In it, he reviews the hazards of sleep deprivation, and shares a variety of methods found to improve sleep quality and quantity.

About 70% of Britons feel they get less sleep than they need, and about a third report suffering from insomnia, Mosley says. His own problem has to do with staying asleep. While he has no problem falling asleep initially, he wakes up around 3 a.m. and has a hard time drifting off again. “I’m simply not getting enough sleep,” he says.

How Much Sleep Is Required for Health?
As noted by Mosley, the standard recommendation for adults is to get seven to eight hours of sleep per night. Teenagers need around nine hours, while younger school-kiage children may need upward of 11 hours.

While insomnia is one reason cited for lack of sleep, there are many other causes as well, including shift work and excessive partying. Our modern lifestyle, which glamorizes constant internet connectivity and round-the-clock activity, essentially conspires to keep us awake far longer than is healthy.

How can you tell if you’re actually sleep deprived or getting the “right” amount of sleep for you? Mosley demonstrates a test that can clue you in. It’s simple. Just go to bed in the middle of the afternoon and time how long it takes you to fall asleep. To conduct this sleep onset latency test, all you need is a watch, a metal spoon and a metal tray.

Place the metal tray next to your bed and lay down, holding the spoon in your hand so that when it falls, it will fall onto the tray. Relax. When you start falling asleep, the muscles in your hand will relax, causing the spoon to drop. The clanking will wake you up. Look at your watch. How long did it take you to drift off?

If it takes you more than 15 minutes, you’re getting enough sleep. If you fall asleep in less than 10 minutes, you’re moderately sleep deprived. Falling asleep in five minutes or less is indicative of severe sleep deprivation.

The High Cost of Sleep Deprivation
The price tag for sleep deprivation is steep. A bleary-eyed workforce costs the U.K. up to £40 billion (about $59 billion) a year in low productivity and absenteeism, Mosley notes. When asking random people on the street what keeps them up at night, the answers are manifold.

Many younger adults cite internet videos and social media. Working out in the evening, mental worries and a disruptive partner are other reasons people give for not getting enough shut-eye.

What Happens During Sleep?
Sleep is not just one long, solid state. Healthy sleep consists of several stages,1 each stage lasting five to 15 minutes, with a complete cycle (light, deep and rapid eye movement or REM sleep) taking between 90 and 120 minutes.

A full sleep cycle starts out in light sleep and progresses through to deep sleep, then reverses back from deep to light sleep before entering REM. You cycle through each of these stages four to six times during the night, and this cycling is tremendously important, from both a biological and psychological perspective.

            No matter your age or fitness level, these activities are some of the best exercises you can do and will help you get in shape and lower your risk for disease:

1. Swimming
You might call swimming the best workout. The buoyancy of the water supports your body and takes the strain off painful joints so you can move them more fluidly. "Swimming is good for individuals with arthritis because it's less weight-bearing," explains Dr. I-Min Lee, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.

Research has found that swimming can also improve your mental state and put you in a better mood. Water aerobics is another option. These classes help you burn calories and tone up.

2. Tai chi
This Chinese martial art that combines movement and relaxation is good for both body and mind. In fact, it's been called "meditation in motion." Tai chi is made up of a series of graceful movements, one transitioning smoothly into the next. Because the classes are offered at various levels, tai chi is accessible — and valuable — for people of all ages and fitness levels. "It's particularly good for older people because balance is an important component of fitness, and balance is something we lose as we get older," Dr. Lee says.

Take a class to help you get started and learn the proper form. You can find tai chi programs at your local YMCA, health club, community center, or senior center.

3. Strength training
If you believe that strength training is a macho, brawny activity, think again. Lifting light weights won't bulk up your muscles, but it will keep them strong. "If you don't use muscles, they will lose their strength over time," Dr. Lee says.

Muscle also helps burn calories. "The more muscle you have, the more calories you burn, so it's easier to maintain your weight," says Dr. Lee. Similar to other exercise, strength training may also help preserve brain function in later years.
4. Walking
Walking is simple, yet powerful. It can help you stay trim, improve cholesterol levels, strengthen bones, keep blood pressure in check, lift your mood, and lower your risk for a number of diseases (diabetes and heart disease, for example). A number of studies have shown that walking and other physical activities can even improve memory and resist age-related memory loss.

All you need is a well-fitting and supportive pair of shoes. Start with walking for about 10 to15 minutes at a time. Over time, you can start to walk farther and faster, until you're walking for 30 to 60 minutes on most days of the week.

5. Kegel exercises
These exercises won't help you look better, but they do something just as important — strengthen the pelvic floor muscles that support the bladder. Strong pelvic floor muscles can go a long way toward preventing incontinence. While many women are familiar with Kegels, these exercises can benefit men too.

To do a Kegel exercise correctly, squeeze the muscles you would use to prevent yourself from passing urine or gas. Hold the contraction for two or three seconds, then release. Make sure to completely relax your pelvic floor muscles after the contraction. Repeat 10 times. Try to do four to five sets a day.

            1. Berries
Be it blackberries, cranberries, strawberries or blueberries, berries of all kinds are super nutritious. Apart from being immensely rich in fibre, berries are quite low in fat, have a low calorie count, and are loaded with antioxidants. Its high mineral and vitamin density makes it an excellent type of fruit to consume. You can have them in their whole form to reap maximum benefits. 
2. Apple
Apple is one super-fruit that can prove to be quite beneficial in your weight loss journey. Rich in dietary fibre, flavonoids and beta-carotene, apple helps in increasing your level of satiety, further preventing you from overeating. The soluble fibre present in the fruit helps in drawing water from your digestive tract, which ultimately forms into a gel-like substance. This further slows the digestion and helps push the stool through the intestines smoothly, thereby aiding both digestion and weight loss.
3. Watermelon
Watermelon is loaded with health-benefiting properties. The high water content in it, about 94%, could possibly help you lose weight as well. It comes under the category of negative calorie fruit, since it tends to burn more calories during digestion than adding in. 
4. Orange
This nutrient-dense low-calorie fruit is the perfect pick to boost your immunity levels. It is abundantly rich in antioxidants and has zero fat content. Savour it as a whole to make the most of its fibre content.

5. Guava
This green, crunchy fruit aids better bowel movement and promotes digestion. The protein and good fibres in this fruit take a little long to digest, which helps in keeping you full for a longer duration of time. You can munch on it before your workout session as well

            You probably heard someone say to you, “Enjoy your sleep while you can,” at some point before your baby arrived into this world.

Now that your newborn is here, this age-old (maybe even cruel?) advice seems to be smacking you in the sleep-deprived face. 

Sleeplessness or sleep deprivation in parenthood may be a rite of passage, but it shouldn’t be. Sleep is important for your newborn but it’s also one of the best things you can do for yourself.

“Good, quality sleep is a cornerstone of good health and well-being,” said Russell Horton, DO, a physician with Banner Health in Phoenix, AZ. “It can lower stress, help you think more clearly and improve mood, maintain a healthy body weight and help boost your immune system.”

Although getting your recommended amount of sleep may seem more like a distant memory than a reality these days, quality sleep is still possible.

Dr. Horton shared 7 sleeping tips for new parents.

1. Try and sleep when the baby sleeps.\n

2. Get your head in the game … the sleep game.\n

3. Place the crib or bassinet near your bed.\n

4. Take shifts.\n

5. Ask for and accept help. \n

6. Take advantage of parental leave. \n

7. Take care of yourself.

            I’m 30 and having my first child. I’m over the moon and so excited to meet him or her. But I am so so unhappy with how I look and how much weight I have gained.
            I am only 15 weeks pregnant and have already gained 11 pounds ~ I didn’t have morning sickness and so started packing on the pounds from day one.

I’m worried as I estimate at this rate by the time I’m 30 weeks it will be 22 pounds if not more, and by 40 weeks I’ll probably be up to 33 or more as they the last few weeks is when you put on the most weight.
I’m having nightmares, crying about it during the day, I haven’t left the house in over a week and I have given up socializing because I feel so uncomfortable. I’m at a loss of what to do.

I will not starve my baby…
I exercise a minimum of 30 minutes 5/6 times a week (easy cycling)
I am also very conscious of what I eat, keeping it healthy and natural.
I really try to limit my unhealthy snacks!

I cannot see where I am going wrong or why my body is failing me.

            In this BBC program, “The Truth About Sleep,” which originally aired in 2017, Mosley investigates the health ramifications of insomnia, which is a problem he shares with many others in the world. In it, he reviews the hazards of sleep deprivation, and shares a variety of methods found to improve sleep quality and quantity.

About 70% of Britons feel they get less sleep than they need, and about a third report suffering from insomnia, Mosley says. His own problem has to do with staying asleep. While he has no problem falling asleep initially, he wakes up around 3 a.m. and has a hard time drifting off again. “I’m simply not getting enough sleep,” he says.

How Much Sleep Is Required for Health?
As noted by Mosley, the standard recommendation for adults is to get seven to eight hours of sleep per night.

            No matter your age or fitness level, these activities are some of the best exercises you can do and will help you get in shape and lower your risk for disease:

1. Swimming
You might call swimming the best workout. The buoyancy of the water supports your body and takes the strain off painful joints so you can move them more fluidly. "Swimming is good for individuals with arthritis because it's less weight-bearing," explains Dr. I-Min Lee, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.

Research has found that swimming can also improve your mental state and put you in a better mood. Water aerobics is another option. These classes help you burn calories and tone up.

2. Tai chi
This Chinese martial art that combines movement and relaxation is good for both body and mind. In fact, it's been called "meditation in motion." Tai chi is made up of a series of graceful movements, one transitioning smoothly into the next. Because the classes are offered at various levels, tai chi is accessible — and valuable — for people of all ages and fitness levels. "It's particularly good for older people because balance is an important component of fitness, and balance is something we lose as we get older," Dr. Lee says.

Take a class to help you get started and learn the proper form. You can find tai chi programs at your local YMCA, health club, community center, or senior center.

3. Strength training
If you believe that strength training is a macho, brawny activity, think again. Lifting light weights won't bulk up your muscles, but it will keep them strong. "If you don't use muscles, they will lose their strength over time," Dr. Lee says.

Muscle also helps burn calories. "The more muscle you have, the more calories you burn, so it's easier to maintain your weight," says Dr. Lee. Similar to other exercise, strength training may also help preserve brain function in later years.
4. Walking
Walking is simple, yet powerful. It can help you stay trim, improve cholesterol levels, strengthen bones, keep blood pressure in check, lift your mood, and lower your risk for a number of diseases (diabetes and heart disease, for example). A number of studies have shown that walking and other physical activities can even improve memory and resist age-related memory loss.

All you need is a well-fitting and supportive pair of shoes. Start with walking for about 10 to15 minutes at a time. Over time, you can start to walk farther and faster, until you're walking for 30 to 60 minutes on most days of the week.

5. Kegel exercises
These exercises won't help you look better, but they do something just as important — strengthen the pelvic floor muscles that support the bladder. Strong pelvic floor muscles can go a long way toward preventing incontinence. While many women are familiar with Kegels, these exercises can benefit men too.

To do a Kegel exercise correctly, squeeze the muscles you would use to prevent yourself from passing urine or gas. Hold the contraction for two or three seconds, then release. Make sure to completely relax your pelvic floor muscles after the contraction. Repeat 10 times. Try to do four to five sets a day.

            1. Berries
Be it blackberries, cranberries, strawberries or blueberries, berries of all kinds are super nutritious. Apart from being immensely rich in fibre, berries are quite low in fat, have a low calorie count, and are loaded with antioxidants. Its high mineral and vitamin density makes it an excellent type of fruit to consume. You can have them in their whole form to reap maximum benefits. 
2. Apple
Apple is one super-fruit that can prove to be quite beneficial in your weight loss journey. Rich in dietary fibre, flavonoids and beta-carotene, apple helps in increasing your level of satiety, further preventing you from overeating. The soluble fibre present in the fruit helps in drawing water from your digestive tract, which ultimately forms into a gel-like substance. This further slows the digestion and helps push the stool through the intestines smoothly, thereby aiding both digestion and weight loss.
3. Watermelon
Watermelon is loaded with health-benefiting properties. The high water content in it, about 94%, could possibly help you lose weight as well. It comes under the category of negative calorie fruit, since it tends to burn more calories during digestion than adding in.
