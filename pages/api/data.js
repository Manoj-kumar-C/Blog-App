            If you're not sure whether a particular activity is safe during pregnancy, check with your health care provider. Consider avoiding:

Any exercises that force you to lie flat on your back after your first trimester
Scuba diving, which could put your baby at risk of decompression sickness
Contact sports, such as ice hockey, soccer, basketball and volleyball
Activities that pose a high risk of falling — such as downhill skiing, in-line skating, gymnastics, and horseback riding
Activities that could cause you to hit water with great force, such as water skiing, surfing and diving
Other activities to avoid include:

Exercise at high altitude
Activities that could cause you to experience direct trauma to the abdomen, such as kickboxing
Hot yoga or hot Pilates
If you do exercise at a high altitude, make sure you know the signs and symptoms of altitude sickness, such as headache, fatigue and nausea. If you experience symptoms of altitude sickness, return to a lower altitude as soon as possible and seek medical care.

            When considering exercises for pregnancy, Cates says there aren’t a lot of activities that need to be removed from your current regimen.

“While the majority of exercises can be continued throughout each trimester, modifying and scaling back where needed can help increase the strength, stability, and physical adaptability as your body changes,” she says.

With that in mind, here are some general safety tips to consider when exercising during pregnancy, according to the ACOG.

            1. Skater steps
For this stair climbing exercise, you need to look at the flight of stairs. Keep your right foot close to the corner of the second step. Next, with your left leg, place it on the other side of the fourth step.

Follow this all the way till you climb a flight of stairs. Going down the way you came will count as one set. You need to complete at least 2 sets for this exercise to be effective. To increase the number of calories you burn, you should swing both your arms.

2. Stair lunge

Another stair climbing exercise that works well is the stair lunge. While your back faces the flight of stairs, you should move your right leg back, until it is on a step.

As you inhale, start to bend your knees. Make sure your knees don’t go as low as your toes. When you exhale, you should get up and return to the original position. Do at least ten reps on both legs, to experience the benefits of stair lunges.

3. Stair push-up

For this stair climbing exercise, you need to place your arms on a step. Make sure you extend your body until it enters the plank position. If you feel your core muscles, you are in the right pose. As you inhale, you should start to lower your body until your chest almost touches the stairs.

The next step is to exhale and bring your body back to its original position. Make sure your hands and shoulders are in the same line. Also, do not let your hips drop, nor change the position of the back and neck.

4. Step up

Make sure you look at the flight of stairs while keeping your feet at the distance of your shoulders. As you tighten the core, place the right foot on the step. Make sure you keep the back straight at all times for this stair climbing exercise.

Keep your weight on the right foot, before breathing out and placing your left foot on the same step. Breathe in and keep your right foot to the previous location. Do the same thing with your left foot. You should do this at least ten times (both legs) to experience the benefits of step ups.

5. Varied pace step climbing
If you are looking for a slightly less intense stair climbing exercise with varied pace, step climbing is the way to go. Not only is it less intense , but you can also use it as a warm-up.

You should start with running up a flight of stairs while looking straight and keeping your shoulders back. When you are on top of the stairs, you should pause and walk down the stairs slowly. This counts as a single set, and you must complete at least 3-5 sets, for it to be effective.

            The digestive system is the most essential yet sensitive part of the human body. It consists of the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, and gallbladder.

It is essentially responsible for breaking down foods and liquids into chemical components such as protein, fats, and carbohydrates. Furthermore, it helps the body absorb these nutrients, utilising them as energy for proper functioning. Therefore, specific foods for the digestive system can help improve it whenever there is a process breakdown.

Our bodily functions depend heavily on food, which defines our internal health. A properly working digestive system plays a significant role in absorbing nutrients in the bloodstream, which are the body’s building blocks. Hence, maintaining an equilibrium of nutrients is essential for the proper functioning of the body.

            category: "Health",

            description: `
            In this BBC program, “The Truth About Sleep,” which originally aired in 2017, Mosley investigates the health ramifications of insomnia, which is a problem he shares with many others in the world. In it, he reviews the hazards of sleep deprivation, and shares a variety of methods found to improve sleep quality and quantity.

About 70% of Britons feel they get less sleep than they need, and about a third report suffering from insomnia, Mosley says. His own problem has to do with staying asleep. While he has no problem falling asleep initially, he wakes up around 3 a.m. and has a hard time drifting off again. “I’m simply not getting enough sleep,” he says.

How Much Sleep Is Required for Health?
As noted by Mosley, the standard recommendation for adults is to get seven to eight hours of sleep per night. Teenagers need around nine hours, while younger school-kiage children may need upward of 11 hours.

While insomnia is one reason cited for lack of sleep, there are many other causes as well, including shift work and excessive partying. Our modern lifestyle, which glamorizes constant internet connectivity and round-the-clock activity, essentially conspires to keep us awake far longer than is healthy.

How can you tell if you’re actually sleep deprived or getting the “right” amount of sleep for you? Mosley demonstrates a test that can clue you in. It’s simple. Just go to bed in the middle of the afternoon and time how long it takes you to fall asleep. To conduct this sleep onset latency test, all you need is a watch, a metal spoon and a metal tray.

Place the metal tray next to your bed and lay down, holding the spoon in your hand so that when it falls, it will fall onto the tray. Relax. When you start falling asleep, the muscles in your hand will relax, causing the spoon to drop. The clanking will wake you up. Look at your watch. How long did it take you to drift off?

If it takes you more than 15 minutes, you’re getting enough sleep. If you fall asleep in less than 10 minutes, you’re moderately sleep deprived. Falling asleep in five minutes or less is indicative of severe sleep deprivation.

The High Cost of Sleep Deprivation
The price tag for sleep deprivation is steep. A bleary-eyed workforce costs the U.K. up to £40 billion (about $59 billion) a year in low productivity and absenteeism, Mosley notes. When asking random people on the street what keeps them up at night, the answers are manifold.

Many younger adults cite internet videos and social media. Working out in the evening, mental worries and a disruptive partner are other reasons people give for not getting enough shut-eye.

What Happens During Sleep?
Sleep is not just one long, solid state. Healthy sleep consists of several stages,1 each stage lasting five to 15 minutes, with a complete cycle (light, deep and rapid eye movement or REM sleep) taking between 90 and 120 minutes.

A full sleep cycle starts out in light sleep and progresses through to deep sleep, then reverses back from deep to light sleep before entering REM. You cycle through each of these stages four to six times during the night, and this cycling is tremendously important, from both a biological and psychological perspective.

            No matter your age or fitness level, these activities are some of the best exercises you can do and will help you get in shape and lower your risk for disease:

1. Swimming
You might call swimming the best workout. The buoyancy of the water supports your body and takes the strain off painful joints so you can move them more fluidly. "Swimming is good for individuals with arthritis because it's less weight-bearing," explains Dr. I-Min Lee, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.

Research has found that swimming can also improve your mental state and put you in a better mood. Water aerobics is another option. These classes help you burn calories and tone up.

2. Tai chi
This Chinese martial art that combines movement and relaxation is good for both body and mind. In fact, it's been called "meditation in motion." Tai chi is made up of a series of graceful movements, one transitioning smoothly into the next. Because the classes are offered at various levels, tai chi is accessible — and valuable — for people of all ages and fitness levels. "It's particularly good for older people because balance is an important component of fitness, and balance is something we lose as we get older," Dr. Lee says.

Take a class to help you get started and learn the proper form. You can find tai chi programs at your local YMCA, health club, community center, or senior center.

3. Strength training
If you believe that strength training is a macho, brawny activity, think again. Lifting light weights won't bulk up your muscles, but it will keep them strong. "If you don't use muscles, they will lose their strength over time," Dr. Lee says.

Muscle also helps burn calories. "The more muscle you have, the more calories you burn, so it's easier to maintain your weight," says Dr. Lee. Similar to other exercise, strength training may also help preserve brain function in later years.
4. Walking
Walking is simple, yet powerful. It can help you stay trim, improve cholesterol levels, strengthen bones, keep blood pressure in check, lift your mood, and lower your risk for a number of diseases (diabetes and heart disease, for example). A number of studies have shown that walking and other physical activities can even improve memory and resist age-related memory loss.

All you need is a well-fitting and supportive pair of shoes. Start with walking for about 10 to15 minutes at a time. Over time, you can start to walk farther and faster, until you're walking for 30 to 60 minutes on most days of the week.

5. Kegel exercises
These exercises won't help you look better, but they do something just as important — strengthen the pelvic floor muscles that support the bladder. Strong pelvic floor muscles can go a long way toward preventing incontinence. While many women are familiar with Kegels, these exercises can benefit men too.

To do a Kegel exercise correctly, squeeze the muscles you would use to prevent yourself from passing urine or gas. Hold the contraction for two or three seconds, then release. Make sure to completely relax your pelvic floor muscles after the contraction. Repeat 10 times. Try to do four to five sets a day.

            1. Berries
Be it blackberries, cranberries, strawberries or blueberries, berries of all kinds are super nutritious. Apart from being immensely rich in fibre, berries are quite low in fat, have a low calorie count, and are loaded with antioxidants. Its high mineral and vitamin density makes it an excellent type of fruit to consume. You can have them in their whole form to reap maximum benefits. 
2. Apple
Apple is one super-fruit that can prove to be quite beneficial in your weight loss journey. Rich in dietary fibre, flavonoids and beta-carotene, apple helps in increasing your level of satiety, further preventing you from overeating. The soluble fibre present in the fruit helps in drawing water from your digestive tract, which ultimately forms into a gel-like substance. This further slows the digestion and helps push the stool through the intestines smoothly, thereby aiding both digestion and weight loss.
3. Watermelon
Watermelon is loaded with health-benefiting properties. The high water content in it, about 94%, could possibly help you lose weight as well. It comes under the category of negative calorie fruit, since it tends to burn more calories during digestion than adding in. 
4. Orange
This nutrient-dense low-calorie fruit is the perfect pick to boost your immunity levels. It is abundantly rich in antioxidants and has zero fat content. Savour it as a whole to make the most of its fibre content.

5. Guava
This green, crunchy fruit aids better bowel movement and promotes digestion. The protein and good fibres in this fruit take a little long to digest, which helps in keeping you full for a longer duration of time. You can munch on it before your workout session as well
